This is a project intended for personal use to create a ereader without supporting amazon and to buff my electronic crafting skills a bit.
I have several ways I can tackle it with both SBC's and custom E-Reader boards existing.
My parameters are: Cheap as possible like we want this whole thing to be 20-50 bucks otherwise im gonna have to sell feet pics, soderless if possible as I am both inexperienced with it and donated my shitty one if truely needed I might see if I can convince the school to let me use theirs but I think thats unlikely, I would like to be able to use a touch screen as possible but that may be impossible.
Firstly I would like to see if I can find a Goodwill with some technology to see if I can find tech to cannablize for parts such as touch screens or batteries.
Options for screens:
E-Ink- Unless ur paying large amounts of money the displays are on average 2 inches wich is nice for a small display but a really crappy reader screen.
LCD(Touch)- Decently cheap with options from 30-100 dollars. More power hungry and crappier angles. [https://www.androidcentral.com/best-raspberry-pi-screen](Good site for the screens) 
LCD(Non-Touch most likely stolen from laptop)- Can be plug and play but will take careful disassembly and a compatabile board from online. Also would reqire some sort of interfact to control the screen as it would be non touch. Also would reqire a custom built case. Benifits EXTREMELY CHEAP as I can just steal it from a goodwill laptop and go buckwild.
Options for brains of the operation
Raspberry PI- The classic all americian draft horse of SBC's with the greatest compatability and easiest plug and play aspect. Not designed for mobile devices and a tad expensive
